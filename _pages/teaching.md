Spatial analysis using the sf package in R
======
A seminar for [eco-data-science](https://eco-data-science.github.io/) on 10 March 2020. The session covers one of the most accessible (and tidy-friendly) packages for spatial analysis in R, which is the sf package. I illustrate simple spatial analyses like transforming coordinate systems, making spatial data from non-spatial files, area and distance calculations, buffers, shapefile outputs, and map preparation. You can read the seminar materials [here](https://jacobgellman.github.io/files/eco-data-sci-sf.html) and clone the GitHub repository for it [here](https://github.com/jacobgellman/eco-data-sci-sf).
