Abstract: Wildfire smoke pollution is growing in the western United States. Estimates of the health impacts of wildfire smoke are numerous, but there are few revealed preference estimates for the damages of smoke. Smoke is challenging to value with revealed preference methods because it is a transient environmental bad: it may blanket an area for several days before winds change or a fire is extinguished. In this paper we study a setting where individuals are directly exposed to wildfire smoke and where avoidance behavior is measured with high frequency: outdoor recreation. We combine millions of administrative campground reservation records with satellite data on wildfire, smoke, and air pollution. These data are rich among most studies of recreation, with nearly 1,000 campgrounds, a large geographic reach, detailed individual-level behavior, and high frequency daily data. The data allow us to model sequential recreation decisions under varying information, where preferences are correlated across decisions using a novel control function approach. We estimate that wildfire smoke reduces welfare by \$107 per person per trip. The damage function is increasing and convex when campgrounds are affected by consecutive days of smoke, and is attenuated when smoke events are sufficiently far from active fires. In total, 21.5 million outdoor recreation visits in the western United States are affected by wildfire smoke every year, with annual welfare losses of approximately \$2.3 billion. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence on the costs of wildfire smoke.
