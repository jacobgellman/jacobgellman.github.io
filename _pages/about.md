I am a PhD candidate in Economics and Environmental Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on the economics of land use, wildfire, and housing. Current projects assess the welfare damages of wildfire smoke on outdoor recreation, wildfire risk modeling and homeowners insurance regulation in California, the effects of affordable housing quotas on housing markets, and other wildfire- or housing-related topics.

I received a BA in Economics from the University of Puget Sound in 2013. I subsequently worked as a research assistant and later as an energy economics consultant. Between academic and professional work I lived in Le Havre, France, where I taught English to students aged 13 to 15. I previously ran radio shows at KCSB in Santa Barbara and KUPS in Tacoma. Personal interests include guitar, French, punk, new wave, art, hiking, and basketball.
