I am a PhD student in Economics and Environmental Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on the economics of land use, wildfire, and housing. Current projects assess the effects of wildfire insurance distortions on the housing market, the impact of wildfire on outdoor recreation, dynamic tradeoffs of vegetation management to mitigate wildfire risk, effects of urban rail on real estate values, and estimation of welfare change from affordable housing policy.

I received a BA in Economics from the University of Puget Sound in 2013. I subsequently worked as a research assistant and later as an energy economics consultant. Between academic and professional work I lived in Le Havre, France, where I taught English to students aged 13 to 15. I previously ran a radio show at KCSB in Santa Barbara. Personal interests include guitar, French, punk, new wave, art, and basketball.
