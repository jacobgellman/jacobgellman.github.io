I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Economics at Oregon State University. My research focuses on the economics of climate risk and adaptation. Some current projects investigate the economic cost of hurricane evacuations, climate risk in homeowners insurance markets, and welfare damages of extreme temperatures for outdoor recreation. 

I hold a PhD from the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a researcher at the Earth Research Institute in Santa Barbara I worked on interdisciplinary wildfire issues with economists, ecologists, and other natural scientists. Previously I was an energy economics consultant, where I advised utilities and tribes on energy decisions and produced expert witness testimony for state and federal government entities.

My teaching experience spans natural resource economics, intermediate microeconomics, econometrics, and statistics. Earlier in my career I taught English in the French school system for students aged 13 to 15.
