I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Economics at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Starting in Fall 2025 I will be an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Economics at Oregon State University. 

My research focuses on the economics of climate risk and adaptation. Some current projects investigate the cost of hurricane evacuations, adaptation to climate change and natural disasters in homeowners insurance markets, and welfare damages of wildfire smoke for outdoor recreation. 

I hold a PhD from the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a researcher at the Earth Research Institute in Santa Barbara I worked on interdisciplinary wildfire issues with economists, ecologists, meteorologists, and other natural scientists. Previously I was an energy economics consultant, where I advised utilities and tribes on energy decisions and produced expert witness testimony for state and federal government entities.

My teaching experience spans natural resource economics, intermediate microeconomics, econometrics, and statistics. Earlier in my career I taught English in the French school system for students aged 13 to 15.

Personal interests include guitar, French, punk, new wave, art, hiking, and basketball.
