I am a PhD student in Economics and Environmental Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests are in environmental, resource, and urban economics. Current projects include the impact of wildfire on recreation behavior in the west, as well as estimation of welfare change from affordable housing policy.

I received a BA in Economics from the University of Puget Sound in 2013. I subsequently worked as a research assistant and later as an energy economics consultant. Between academic and professional work I lived in Le Havre, France, where I taught English to students aged 13 to 15.
